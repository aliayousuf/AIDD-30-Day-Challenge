 Reflection 

 Q.   What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?

 Ans. In AI-Driven Development , AI act as co-creator and we act as director or architect. In AIDD we are not write a single line of code or memorize the syntax. we just give clear specifications to AI and AI generate the code for us and after that we validate the output. In this agentic era specification are the new syntax through this revolution the development become faster as compare to the traditional approach where we write the code by ourself.


Q.  How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

Ans. I think in future Human-AI collaboration make the software development much more faster,easy and productive without replacing the human jobs,because this collaboration give both human and AI to learn from each other.Human explain the AI what they want in their specification, AI suggests how it might be done then human evaluate the output and learn from the output that AI generate,now AI learns from human feedback and adapts the human preferences and patterns. This collaboration and co-learning make the software development powerful.
